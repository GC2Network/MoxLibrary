# MoxLibrary
MoxLibrary is a utility library for spigot/bukkit minecraft server plugins. To use it, you need to add dependency into your project.

Please, if you want to use it in multiple plugins or use other MoxPlugins, download and install MoxCore and use it as dependency because this plugin contains this library. Class loader will load all classes just once, so MoxLibrary can be used once per server - please, keep it in mind.
